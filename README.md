Herdr F1 visualizes the status of your running Herdr agents as an F1 race.

![Herdr F1 dashboard showing Herdr workspaces and coding agents as teams and race cars](assets/herdr-f1-dashboard.gif)

Each `workspace` becomes a team, and each `agent terminal` becomes a race car. Agents
race around the circuit while working, wait in the pits while idle, and stop on the
track when blocked. Select a car or a row in the standings to jump directly to its
Herdr terminal.

Laps, standings, and points are fictional data created for spectating. They do not
measure productivity or agent performance.

## Quick start

Requirements:

- macOS or Linux
- A running [Herdr](https://github.com/ogulcancelik/herdr) 0.7.4 or later
- Node.js 20 or later

Choose either the Herdr plugin or the CLI.

```sh
# Herdr plugin
herdr plugin install hmu332233/herdr-f1
herdr plugin action invoke dev.minung.herdr-f1.open

# CLI
npx herdr-f1 --open
```

### Herdr plugin

Your browser will open, and agents in the current Herdr session will join the race.
To stop the dashboard, run:

```sh
herdr plugin action invoke dev.minung.herdr-f1.stop
```

The plugin includes the server and web assets required to run, so no separate
installation or build is needed.

#### Open with a keyboard shortcut

Add the following to `~/.config/herdr/config.toml` to open the dashboard with
`prefix+f`. The default prefix is `ctrl+b`.

```toml
[[keys.command]]
key = "prefix+f"
type = "plugin_action"
command = "dev.minung.herdr-f1.open"
description = "open F1 dashboard"
```

Apply the updated configuration to the running Herdr session:

```sh
herdr server reload-config
```

### CLI

Run the dashboard directly without installing the Herdr plugin. Omit `--open` to
print the local URL without opening a browser.

```sh
npx herdr-f1 [start] [--port <port>] [--bind <host>] [--open] [--socket <path>]
npx herdr-f1 status [--socket <path>]
npx herdr-f1 stop [--socket <path>]
```

If installed globally, you can omit `npx`. The default port is `4158`; if it is
already in use, Herdr F1 automatically finds the next available port.

The dashboard binds `127.0.0.1` by default. `--bind` accepts any local address,
so `--bind 0.0.0.0` exposes it to every interface — useful when the dashboard
runs inside a VM or container and you reach it through a forwarded port. Only
loopback is private: on any other address, anyone who can route to the machine
can open the dashboard and focus your terminals.

`start` and `status` print every address the dashboard answers on, so a
wildcard bind lists the addresses another device would use:

```
Herdr F1 · http://127.0.0.1:4158
Also on http://192.168.0.2:4158
```

### Multiplayer race modes

Start a host, then have each team run the printed `join` command on a machine
with Herdr. `classic` remains the default. `continuous` keeps idle, completed,
mixed-state, and offline teams circulating at cruising pace; blocked crews stop
and deploy a queue-forming Safety Car. Every car may close the field, but only a
working car may overtake on track. Working also consumes visible tyre life;
worn cars make a mandatory stop that can change the order.

```sh
npx herdr-f1 host [--port <port>] [--bind <host>] --race-mode classic
npx herdr-f1 host --race-mode continuous
npx herdr-f1 join <host[:port]> --name <team-name>
```

A host binds `0.0.0.0` by default — reaching other machines is the point of the
mode — and prints every address a viewer or joining team can use, loopback
last. `--bind` narrows that: a specific address keeps the party off the other
interfaces, and `--bind 127.0.0.1` makes a host that only this machine can
join, which is what you want when the browser reaches it through a forwarded
port rather than over the network.

The host owns race mode, venue rotation, scoring, and race control. Viewers can
see those rules but cannot change them. Continuous mode rotates venues with a
shuffle bag, showing every circuit once before reshuffling.

## How it works

| Herdr status | Dashboard |
| --- | --- |
| `working` | Racing on the circuit |
| `idle` | Waiting in the pits |
| `done` | Finished racing |
| `blocked` | Stopped after an incident |

### Team radio

Status changes are announced as pit-wall radio along the bottom of the screen:
a car heading for the pits, an incident, a chequered flag. Select a line to jump
to that agent's Herdr terminal.

Radio lines are invented commentary picked from a fixed script by which status
change occurred, exactly like laps and points. **They are never an agent's
actual output** — the dashboard cannot read what an agent says.

The dashboard reads Herdr session status and only sends a terminal-focus command
when you select a car. It does not collect terminal output or conversation content,
and the server binds only to `127.0.0.1` to prevent external access.

## Troubleshooting

If the plugin does not open, check its installation status and recent logs:

```sh
herdr plugin list --plugin dev.minung.herdr-f1
herdr plugin log list --plugin dev.minung.herdr-f1 --limit 20
```

To check the status and URL of a dashboard started from the CLI, run:

```sh
npx herdr-f1 status
```

## Development

```sh
npm install
npm test
npm run typecheck
npm run build
```

To connect a local checkout to Herdr, run:

```sh
herdr plugin link .
```

To recognize a contributor, update `.all-contributorsrc` and regenerate the table:

```sh
npx all-contributors generate
```

Bug reports and pull requests are welcome.
